You can see how to perform [this in the related stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4099422/printing-slowly-simulate-typing).  To display this in a test you need to run `pytest -s tests/`.  So you have to pass the `-s` flag for it to display in the test.  If you want to skip the display, just remove the `-s`.\n",
